1) Encapsulation ---
     Bundling of Features: Combining variables and methods into one Class.

     Belong to Object: Data is tied to specific instances.

     Inside a Class: Uses private modifiers to keep data "inside."
2) Inheritance ---
     Reuse of Features: Subclass acquires methods and fields from a Superclass.

     Belong to Hierarchy: Uses the extends keyword to link classes.

     Inside a Subclass: Accesses parent features using the super keyword.
3) Abstraction ---
     Hiding of Features: Hiding internal implementation details from the user. 

      Belong to Interface: Focuses on the "contract" or blueprint.

      Inside an Abstract Class: Uses the abstract keyword for methods without bodies.
4) Polymorphism ---

     Changing of Features: One action (method) performs differently in different contexts.

     Belong to Methods: Overloading (same name, different params) or Overriding.

     Inside the JVM: Determined at runtime based on the actual Object type.
